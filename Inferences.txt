After observing  the obtained data and graphs, few things that can be considered before launching an app in order achieve higher ratings are:
1. Keeping the price as low as possible because from the obtained graph between price and User rating count, we can see that  that low price
    will attract more users to download the app.
2. Also rating of 4.0 has maximum frequency and most of them are found at the low price range, so obviously we need to keep the prices low.
